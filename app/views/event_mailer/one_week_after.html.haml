  Dear Officers of #{@event.organization.name},
%p
  Hi! We hope that your event "#{@event.title}" was a success!
  We just wanted to remind you that you have until #{@event.ends.to_date + 2.weeks}
  to submit any itemized receipts or other Purchase Requests on SpartanLink.
%p
  You can create a Purchase Request on your organization's SpartanLink page by clicking on "Finance" and then on "Create Purchase Request".
  = link_to 'Or, click here to be taken to the page.', "#{@event.organization.collegiatelink_url}Finance/CreatePurchaseRequest"
%p
  %b
    Remember that all requests must be first completed online, then printed out
    and turned in (with the original receipt attached) to the brown box in the
    USG Office.
%p
  Any unspent funds after #{@event.ends.to_date + 2.weeks} may be reallocated to
  other groups' events, so it is very important to turn in your Purchase
  Requests on time. If you need longer for any reason, please contact your
  group's USG Treasurer to arrange as such before next week.
